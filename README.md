DUMBO: Deflate Unnecessary Megabytes By Overwriting

A script to ID files based on MD5 hash and reduce the file to zero bytes if the hash exists in a provided list. 

This will leave the folder and file structure unchanged.

The intended application was to aid in reducing the size of digital forensic training data sets while providing the appearance of a complete system.  

It can also be used to redact file data for case work related to ICAC or similar issues where file representation and nonproliferation are required.
